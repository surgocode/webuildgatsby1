This will register for the `obsidian://` custom protocol handler in the Windows registry.\n- On MacOS, running the app once should be sufficient, however, your app **must** be installer version 0.8.12 or later.\n- On Linux, there's a much more involved process:\n\t- First, ensure you create a `obsidian.desktop` file. [See here for details](https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en)\n\t- Ensure that your desktop file specifies the `Exec` field as `Exec=executable %u`. The `%u` is used to pass the `obsidian://` URIs to the app.\n\t- If you're using the AppImage installer, you may have to unpack it using `Obsidian-x.y.z.AppImage --appimage-extract`. Then make sure the `Exec` directive points to the unpacked executable.\n\n## Using Obsidian URIs\n\nObsidian URIs are typically in this format:\n\n```\nobsidian://action?param1=value&param2=value\n```\n\n- The `action` is usually the action that you would like to perform.\n\n### Encoding\n\n==Important==\n\nEnsure that your values are properly URI encoded. For example, forward slash characters `/` must be encoded as `%2F` and space characters must be encoded as `%20`.\n\nThis is especially important because an improperly encoded \"reserved\" character may break the interpretation of the URI. [See here for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)\n\n### Available actions\n\n#### Action `open`\n\nDescription: Opens an Obsidian vault, and possibly open a file within that vault.\n\nPossible parameters:\n\n- `vault` can be either the vault name, or the vault ID.\n\t- The vault name is simply the name of the vault folder.\n\t- The vault ID is the random 16-character code assigned to the vault. This ID is unique per folder on your computer. Example: `ef6ca3e3b524d22f`. There isn't an easy way to find this ID yet, one will be offered at a later date in the vault switcher. Currently it can be found in `%appdata%/obsidian/obsidian.json` for Windows. For MacOS, replace `%appdata%` with `~/Library/Application Support/`. For Linux, replace `%appdata%` with `~/.config/`.\n- `file` can be either a file name, or a path from the vault root to the specified file.\n\t- To resolve the target file, Obsidian uses the same link resolution system as a regular `[[wikilink]]` within the vault.\n\t- If the file extension is `md`, the extension can be omitted.\n- `path` an absolute file system path to a file.\n\t- Using this parameter will override both `vault` and `file`.\n\t- This will cause the app to search for the most specific vault which contains the specified file path.\n\t- Then the rest of the path replaces the `file` parameter.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`. If the vault is already open, focus on the window.\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=ef6ca3e3b524d22f`\n\tThis opens the vault identified by the ID `ef6ca3e3b524d22f`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=my%20note`\n\tThis opens the note `my note` in the vault `my vault`, assuming `my note` exists and the file is `my note.md`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=my%20note.md`\n\tThis also opens the note `my note` in the vault `my vault`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=path%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`\n\tThis opens the note located at `path/to/my note` in the vault `my vault`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?path=%2Fhome%2Fuser%2Fmy%20vault%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`\n\tThis will look for any vault that contains the path `/home/user/my vault/path/to/my note`. Then, the rest of the path is passed to the `file` parameter. For example, if a vault exists at `/home/user/my vault`, then this would be equivalent to `file` parameter set to `path/to/my note`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?path=D%3A%5CDocuments%5CMy%20vault%5CMy%20note`\n\tThis will look for any vault that contains the path `D:\\Documents\\My vault\\My note`. Then, the rest of the path is passed to the `file` parameter. For example, if a vault exists at `D:\\Documents\\My vault`, then this would be equivalent to `file` parameter set to `My note`.\n\t\n#### Action `search`\n\nDescription: Opens the search pane for a vault, and optionally perform a search query.\n\nPossible parameters:\n\n- `vault` can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. Same as action `open`.\n- `query` (optional) The search query to perform.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `obsidian://search?vault=my%20vault`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`, and opens the search pane.\n\n- `obsidian://search?vault=my%20vault&query=MOC`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`, opens the search pane, and performs a search for `MOC`.\n\t\n#### Action `new`\n\nDescription: Creates a new note in the vault, optionally with some content.\n\nPossible parameters:\n\n- `vault` can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. Same as action `open`.\n- `name` the file name to be created. If this is specified, the file location will be chosen based on your \"Default location for new notes\" preferences.\n- `file` a vault absolute path, including the name. Will override `name` if specified.\n- `path` a globally absolute path. Works similar to the `path` option in the `open` action, which will override both `vault` and `file`.\n- `content` (optional) the contents of the note.\n- `silent` (optional) set this if you don't want to open the new note.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `obsidian://new?vault=my%20vault&name=my%20note`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`, and creates a new note called `my note`.\n- `obsidian://new?vault=my%20vault&path=path%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`, and creates a new note at `path/to/my note`.\n\t\n#### Action `hook-get-address`\n\nDescription: Endpoint for use with [Hook](https://hookproductivity.com/). Copies a markdown link of the current focused note to the clipboard, as an `obsidian://open` URL. Use: `obsidian://hook-get-address`\n\nPossible parameters:\n\n- `vault` (optional) can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. If not provided, the current or last focused vault will be used.\n\n## Shorthand formats\n\nIn addition to the formats above, there are two more \"shorthand\" formats available to open vaults and files:\n\n- `obsidian://vault/my vault/my note` is equivalent to `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=my%20note`\n- `obsidian:///absolute/path/to/my note` is equivalent to `obsidian://open?path=%2Fabsolute%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`\n","excerpt":"Obsidian supports a custom URI protocol  obsidian://  which can be used to trigger various actions within the app. This is
